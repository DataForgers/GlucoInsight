## 🧠 About the Project

**GlucoInsight** is a dual-model machine learning platform designed for early diabetes risk assessment.  
It compares two predictive approaches:

- **Model 1:** Symptom-Based Model  
- **Model 2:** Health Indicator-Based Model

The platform is designed to improve awareness, accessibility, and accuracy of diabetes screening, especially in low-resource environments.

## 🚀 Features

- 🧪 **Symptom-based Risk Detection**  
- 📊 **Health Indicator-Based Prediction**  
- ⚖️ Class Balancing using **SMOTE**  
- 📈 Interactive Visualizations with **Plotly**  
- 🧠 **ML Models:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost  
- 🖥️ Deployed via **Streamlit** for accessibility  
- 📚 Educational resources on diabetes

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User selects a prediction method:  
   - Symptoms or  
   - Health indicators

2. Model processes inputs through pre-trained ML models

3. Results are displayed with:
   - Risk score
   - Confidence level
   - Visual feedback
   - Health recommendation

4. App includes an **educational section** to raise awareness
